# Example config file for nview
# The values shown below correspond to the in-code defaults

app:
  # Display name for the node
  #
  # This can also be set via the NODE_NAME environment variable
  nodeName: Cardano Node

  # Named Cardano network for the node
  #
  # This is a short-cut to select the NetworkMagic and can be used to
  # select mainnet, preprod, preview, or sancho networks.
  #
  # This can also be set via the NETWORK environment variable and overrides
  # the node specific setting below
  network:

node:
  # Name of the node you are running.
  #
  # Valid values are:
  # - `amaru`
  # - `cardano-node`
  # - `dingo`
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_NODE_BINARY environment variable
  binary: cardano-node

  # Named Cardano network for the node
  #
  # This is a short-cut to select the NetworkMagic and can be used to
  # select mainnet, preprod, preview, or sancho networks.
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_NETWORK environment variable
  network: mainnet

  # NetworkMagic for network for the node
  #
  # This selects the correct network for operation and can be configured to
  # any network, not just the named networks.
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_MAGIC environment
  # variable
  networkMagic:

  # Port for the node
  #
  # Listening port for the node for NtN communication.
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_PORT environment variable
  port: 3001

  # Path to the PID file for the node
  #
  # This is only used when the `binary` value is `amaru`.
  # Otherwise it is ignored.
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_NODE_PID_FILE environment variable
  pidFile:

  # PID for the node process
  #
  # When set to a non-zero value, this bypasses all automatic PID detection
  # mechanisms and directly uses the specified PID for process metrics.
  #
  # - For cardano-node: Bypasses name/port-based detection
  # - For Dingo: Overrides the default PID 1 (when set to non-zero)
  # - For Amaru: Skips reading from pidFile and uses this PID directly
  #
  # This can also be set via the CARDANO_NODE_PID environment variable
  pid: 0

prometheus:
  # host/port for the node Prometheus metrics
  #
  # These can also be set via the PROM_HOST and PROM_PORT environment variables
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 12798

  # Timeout for connections to the node
  #
  # This can also be set via the PROM_TIMEOUT environment variable
  timeout: 3

# Example configurations for different node implementations:
#
# For Dingo:
# node:
#   binary: dingo
#   network: mainnet
#
# For Dingo with custom PID:
# node:
#   binary: dingo
#   network: mainnet
#   pid: 1234  # Override default PID 1
#
# For Amaru:
# node:
#   binary: amaru
#   network: mainnet
#   pidFile: /path/to/amaru.pid  # Required for Amaru
#
# For Amaru with direct PID (skips pidFile):
# node:
#   binary: amaru
#   network: mainnet
#   pid: 5678  # Use this PID directly, ignore pidFile
#
# For cardano-node with direct PID:
# node:
#   binary: cardano-node
#   network: mainnet
#   port: 3001
#   pid: 9999  # Bypass name/port detection
#
# For custom Prometheus port:
# prometheus:
#   host: 127.0.0.1
#   port: 9090
#   timeout: 5
